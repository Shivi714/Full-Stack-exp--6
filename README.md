# Experiment 1 – Handling Forms Using Controlled Components in React

## 📌 Aim

To create and handle forms in a frontend application using controlled components in React.

---

## 🧰 Software Requirements

* Node.js
* React (Vite)
* VS Code
* Web Browser

---

## 📖 Theory

Controlled components are React components in which form data is handled by the component’s state.

This means:

* React state stores input values
* Input fields update state using event handlers
* Form submission is handled through functions

This provides complete control over user input and makes form handling predictable and efficient.

---

## ⚙️ Features

✔ Controlled form inputs
✔ useState for state management
✔ Input change handling
✔ Form submission handling
✔ Live form data preview
✔ Modern responsive UI

---

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### Step 1 – Create React Project

npm create vite@latest sub-exp1 -- --template react
cd sub-exp1
npm install

### Step 2 – Run Project

npm run dev

Open browser and go to:
http://localhost:5173/

---

## 🧪 Procedure

1. Create a React application using Vite.
2. Create a form component.
3. Use useState to store input values.
4. Handle input change events.
5. Submit the form using an event handler.
